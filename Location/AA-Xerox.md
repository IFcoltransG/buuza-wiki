AA-Xerox is a print shop in [Salwa](Salwa.md) that does printing, copying and fax. [Zach](../Person/Zach.md) got his business cards reprinted from there when he lost them escaping from [Sam](../Person/Sam.md). Zach and [Musa](../Person/Musa.md) went there on their second meeting (technically their third, if counting Musa donating to Zach's collection bucket outside [Habibi's](Habibi's.md)) because Musa needed to print his university work. [Sabbah](../Person/Sabbah.md) and [Rumeha](../Person/Rumeha.md) work there.
