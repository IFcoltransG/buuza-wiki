# Sooq
The sooq is market, in [Dilmun](Location/Regions/Dilmun.md), where [Musa](Person/Musa.md), [Zach](Person/Zach.md) and [Sam](Person/Sam.md) go. [Harshul](Person/Harshul.md) recommends shops on the East Wing of it. It has a train station nearby. The administration shuts down a stall selling [Bird](Bird) scriptures due to complaints, given most of the city (presumably [Salwa](Location/Salwa.md)) is not interested in Bird lore.
