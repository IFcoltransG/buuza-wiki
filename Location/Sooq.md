# Sooq
The sooq is market, in [[Dilmun|Dilmun]], where [[Musa|Musa]], [[Zach|Zach]] and [[Sam|Sam]] go. [[Harshul|Harshul]] recommends shops on the East Wing of it. It has a train station nearby. The administration shuts down a stall selling [[Bird]] scriptures due to complaints, given most of the city (presumably [[Salwa|Salwa]]) is not interested in Bird lore.
