# An Nur and Al Hadi
Bird gods. Supposedly dead gods, persecuted. Not gods of death though. Have no holy family, and are different from [Rasul](Person/Groups/Rasul.md).

An Nur is potentially also called 'Al Nur'. An Nur's followers pray at Fajr, like the followers of [Al 'Mumin](Religion/Al%20Mumin.md).
Followers of Al Hadi usually pray at Mahgrib.
