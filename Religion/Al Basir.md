# Al Basir
Al Basir (he/him) is the brother of [[As Sami|As Sami]]. His name means 'all seeing', and bird lore holds that he and his children were blessed with visions of the future, although this conflicts with Masjid's canon. Not officially celebrated outside of [[Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], just like festivities for [[Al Adl|Al 'Adl]] also being regional. A deer god, Al Basir is viewed as the source of [[Sam|Sam]]'s ability to divine the future.
