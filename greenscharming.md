# greenscharming
Greenscharming is an ability of Rasul to prevent weeds from growing back by blessing a place. The blessing they give follows:

> In the name of the just, her radiance a beacon in the night.
> Bearing witness, her consort, the faithful son of the day.
> I seek protection for this land, O heavenly ones,
> I beseech you, O emissary of light, the bringer of dawn,
> To you, O emissary of sleep, guide through dusk,
> Messengers of the mother, of the beginning, and the end,
> To hold this land still.
> Ameen.

Comparing the descriptions with the iconography on their [Deathhead](Deathhead.md) artworks, the radiant just could potentially be [As Sami](Religion/As%20Sami.md) or [Al 'Adl](Religion/Al%20Adl.md). The faithful son of day might be [Al 'Mumin](Religion/Al%20Mumin.md).

[Sam](Person/Sam.md) works as a greenscharmer, and she enlisted [Zach](Person/Zach.md) to help with it when performing the ritual.
