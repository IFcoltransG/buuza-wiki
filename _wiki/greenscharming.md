Greenscharming is an ability of [Rasul](wiki/rasul.md) to prevent weeds from growing back by blessing a place. The blessing they give follows:

> In the name of The Just, her radiance a beacon in the night.
>
> Bearing witness, her consort, The Faithful Son of the Day.
>
> I seek protection for this land, O heavenly ones,
>
> I beseech you, O Emissary of Light, the Bringer of Dawn,
>
> To you, O Emissary of Sleep, Guide through Dusk,
>
> Messengers of the mother, of the beginning, and the end,
>
> To hold this land still.
>
> Ameen.

Comparing the descriptions with the iconography on their [Deathhead](wiki/deathhead.md) artworks, the Radiant Just could potentially be [Al 'Adl](wiki/al-adl.md). The Faithful Son of Day might be [Al Mu'min](wiki/al-mumin.md). The Emissaries of Light and Sleep may be [An Nur and Al Hadi](wiki/an-nur-and-al-hadi.md). In real-world Islam, those four names are used to refer to justice, faith, light, and guidance, respectively, in the context of Allah.

[Sam](wiki/sam.md) works as a greenscharmer, and she enlisted [Zach](wiki/zach.md) to help with it when performing the ritual.
