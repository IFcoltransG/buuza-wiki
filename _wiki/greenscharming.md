Greenscharming is an ability of [Rasul](wiki/Person/Group/Rasul.md) to prevent weeds from growing back by blessing a place. The blessing they give follows:

> In the name of The Just, her radiance a beacon in the night.
> Bearing witness, her consort, The Faithful Son of the Day.
> I seek protection for this land, O heavenly ones,
> I beseech you, O Emissary of Light, the Bringer of Dawn,
> To you, O Emissary of Sleep, Guide through Dusk,
> Messengers of the mother, of the beginning, and the end,
> To hold this land still.
> Ameen.

Comparing the descriptions with the iconography on their [Deathhead](wiki/Culture/Deathhead.md) artworks, the Radiant Just could potentially be [Al 'Adl](wiki/Culture/Deity/Al%20Adl.md). The Faithful Son of Day might be [Al Mu'min](wiki/Culture/Deity/Al%20Mumin.md). The Emissaries of Light and Sleep may be [An Nur and Al Hadi](wiki/Culture/Deity/An%20Nur%20and%20Al%20Hadi.md). In real-world Islam, those four names are used to refer to justice, faith, light, and guidance, respectively, in the context of Allah.

[Sam](wiki/Person/Sam.md) works as a greenscharmer, and she enlisted [Zach](wiki/Person/Zach.md) to help with it when performing the ritual.
