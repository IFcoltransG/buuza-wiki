Huang Zhen (he/him) is the third heir to the [Chevalier Business Conglomerate](/_wiki/chevalier-business-conglomerate.md), which he found out on New Year's Eve 1997. This caused him to attempt to call the Sacred Star Charity Emergency Help Line, but instead found [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md). The two fell in love over subsequent phone calls. Zhen lives in [Kashgar](/_wiki/kashgar.md), although he used to live in [Konstantinyye](/_wiki/konstantinyye.md).

He works at a photo studio, developing photographs and handling the bills. He left [Kashgar](/_wiki/kashgar.md) to study photography at [University](/_wiki/university-of-eastern-turkistan.md) of [Eastern Turkistan](/_wiki/eastern-turkistan.md). When he returned, he put his talents to use at the [design collective](/_wiki/design-collective.md) with his friend [Ju](/_wiki/ju.md) who he met at an atalier.

He lives with his [grandfather](/_wiki/zhens-grandfather.md) and [father](/_wiki/zhens-father.md), who are from Kashgar. His mother is [Musa's mother](/_wiki/musas-mother.md), because he is the half-brother of [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) and [Miriam](/_wiki/miriam.md). He does not want to find his siblings, partly because he doesn't want media attention.

He is gay, also vegetarian. He is 24 years old.
