Huang Zhen (he/him) is the third heir to the [Chevalier Business Conglomerate](wiki/chevalier-business-conglomerate.md), which he found out on New Year's Eve 1997. This caused him to attempt to call the Sacred Star Charity Emergency Help Line, but instead found [Zach](wiki/zach.md). The two fell in love over subsequent phone calls. Zhen lives in [Kashgar](wiki/kashgar.md), although he used to live in [Konstantinyye](wiki/konstantinyye.md).

He works at a photo studio, developing photographs and handling the bills. He left [Kashgar](wiki/kashgar.md) to study photography at [University](wiki/University%20of%20eastern-turkistan.md) of [Eastern Turkistan](wiki/eastern-turkistan.md). When he returned, he put his talents to use at the [design collective](wiki/design-collective.md) with his friend [Bai Ju](wiki/bai-ju.md) who he met at an atalier.

He lives with his [grandfather](wiki/Zhen's%20grandfather) and [father](wiki/Zhen's%20father), who are from Kashgar. His mother is [Musa's mother](wiki/musas-mother.md), because he is the half-brother of [Musa](wiki/musa.md) and [Miriam](wiki/miriam.md). He does not want to find his siblings, partly because he doesn't want media attention.

He is gay, also vegetarian. He is 24 years old.
