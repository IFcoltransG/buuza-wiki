The three older sisters of [Aria](/_wiki/aria.md) are important members of the [Al Harir](/_wiki/al-harir.md) dynasty. The sisters were alive when [Zarina's](/_wiki/zarina.md) rebellion failed, and due to her [prophecy](/_wiki/prophecy.md) are concerned by the presence of [Birds](/_wiki/bird.md) in [Dawlat Al-Harir](/_wiki/dawlat-al-harir.md).
