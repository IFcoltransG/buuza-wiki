Huang Zhen (he/him) is the third heir to the [Chevalier Business Conglomerate](wiki/Chevalier%20Business%20Conglomerate.md), which he found out on New Year's Eve 1997. This caused him to attempt to call the Sacred Star Charity Emergency Help Line, but instead found [Zach](wiki/Zach.md). The two fell in love over subsequent phone calls. Zhen lives in [Kashgar](wiki/Kashgar.md), although he used to live in [Konstantinyye](wiki/Konstantinyye.md).

He works at a photo studio, developing photographs and handling the bills. He left [Kashgar](wiki/Kashgar.md) to study photography at [University](wiki/University%20of%20Eastern%20Turkistan.md) of [Eastern Turkistan](wiki/Eastern%20Turkistan.md). When he returned, he put his talents to use at the [design collective](wiki/design%20collective.md) with his friend [Bai Ju](wiki/Bai%20Ju.md) who he met at an atalier.

He lives with his [grandfather](wiki/Zhen's%20grandfather) and [father](wiki/Zhen's%20father), who are from Kashgar. His mother is [Musa's mother](wiki/Musas%20mother.md), because he is the half-brother of [Musa](wiki/Musa.md) and [Miriam](wiki/Miriam.md). He does not want to find his siblings, partly because he doesn't want media attention.

He is gay, also vegetarian. He is 24 years old.
