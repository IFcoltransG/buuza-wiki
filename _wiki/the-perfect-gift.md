'The Perfect Gift' is a chapter of the [comic](/_wiki/index.md), preceded by [Spring Moon at Midnight](/_wiki/spring-moon-at-midnight.md) and followed by [Silent Songs](/_wiki/silent-songs.md).

## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/2205621)
[Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) is losing to [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) at [Deathhead](/_wiki/deathhead.md) when [Zach's mum](/_wiki/leila.md) flies through the window as a [bird](/_wiki/bird.md). She wishes him a happy birthday with firinda sutlac and a new TV, so that they don't have to go to [Habibi's](/_wiki/habibis.md) to watch soap operas. She introduces herself to Musa as Aunty Leila and offers everyone a dessert. They turn it on, but instead of a soap, they see a sermon from [Daeng Aria Bin Dariush](/_wiki/aria.md). Leila decries the extra sermon. To Musa's surprise, she claims Aria isn't a real part of the pantheon, not like the [gods](/_wiki/gods.md). She criticises the scriptures of the five caliphs. [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) leaves to take a phone call.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/2205624)
Over the phone, [Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md) explains why he hasn't called â€” so busy with the festival and the [design collective](/_wiki/design-collective.md) getting a quarter-page feature in a [national](/_wiki/dawlat-al-harir.md) fashion [magazine](/_wiki/meissa-magazine.md). Zhen teases Zach for only just turning 21, when Zhen is about to turn 24 in a month. They say affectionate things to each other.
