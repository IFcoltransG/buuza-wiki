'Spring Moon at Midnight' is a chapter of the [comic](/_wiki/index.md), preceded by [A Family Portrait](/_wiki/a-family-portrait.md) and followed by [The Perfect Gift](/_wiki/the-perfect-gift.md).

## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/2106210)
[Saesha](/_wiki/saesha.md) puts up a sign for ["BUUZA"](/_wiki/buuza-mongolian-diner.md). [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) and [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) work on getting things ready, but Zach has been distracted thinking of [Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md) all day. He tells Sam about how the Zhen situation started, and that he's falling for Zhen.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/2106212)
Zach is confused why he has such strong feelings for Zhen but not anyone else he's dated or worked for. Sam thinks he has made a connection. Zach worries that it's one sided, as since Zhen told him a big secret, he hasn't called. To Sam, this makes complete sense, because everyone in [the east part of the country](/_wiki/eastern-turkistan.md) will be busy celebrating the Moon Festival, the biggest Eid for followers of [Al 'Adl](/_wiki/al-adl.md). It's a celebration of family, and Sam cries remembering celebrating it when she lived with [her father](/_wiki/sams-father.md), making cakes and dancing.
