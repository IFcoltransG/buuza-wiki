'BUUZA!!' is a chapter of the [comic](/_wiki/index.md), preceded by [The Fall Out](/_wiki/the-fall-out.md) and followed by [Golden Hour](/_wiki/golden-hour.md).

## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/3062745)
As [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) and [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) get ready for the opening of [Buuza](/_wiki/buuza-mongolian-diner.md), she explains why she never visited her [father](/_wiki/sams-father.md) in [Mongolia](/_wiki/mongolia.md) since she was taken away from that side of her family. The restaurant opens, with [Rumeha](/_wiki/rumeha.md), [Sabbah](/_wiki/sabbah.md), [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md), [Leila](/_wiki/leila.md), [Nithiya](/_wiki/nithiya.md), [Saesha](/_wiki/saesha.md), [Emira](/_wiki/emira.md), [Omar](/_wiki/omar.md) and [Harshul](/_wiki/harshul.md) all attending the opening. They all toast. Emira misunderstood the word 'buuza' as 'buza' (ice cream) instead of a [meat dumpling](/_wiki/buuza-dish.md). Zach expected that, and prepared ice blocks for them and Omar alongside the buuza.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/3089434)
Harshul convinces Emira to try a buuza. Leila decides to call it a night and flies to the station in bird-form. Rumeha and Sabbah walk back with Harshul. A power blackout hits the district, so Nithiya takes Sam, Zach, Musa, Emira and Omar back to her office while Saesha gets the generator working. Omar proposes they tell ghost stories in the candlelight. The story Nithiya tells is set near [the cursed jungles](/_wiki/jungle.md) at the [country's edge](/_wiki/outside-of-dalwat-al-harir.md), where farmers grow crops in the especially fertile soil despite danger. A farmer is caught out late harvesting a potato field right on the edge of the jungle, and has to return to his home at sunset. He is wary of monkey-like witches who throw rocks at travellers, so when he feels objects hitting the backs of his legs, he runs home as fast as possible. However, when he reaches safety, he realises that the objects were only potatoes falling out of his sack. Musa volunteers to tell the next ghost story.

## [Episode 3](https://tapas.io/episode/3089444)
Musa tells a story of the Farris family's trip to [Parsi](/_wiki/parsi.md) when Musa was very young, so that [Musa's mother](/_wiki/musas-mother.md) could conduct some business. They visited a valley in the mountains that was only accessible by a bus from the nearest city. The return bus didn't arrive to pick them up for many days, and waiting couple said they'd been stuck in the town for two months. At night, they saw red lights in the forest below. The couple managed to leave at night in a cargo truck, and Musa and co followed the next night. The truck stopped in the [jungle](/_wiki/jungle.md) and everyone stayed silent until daybreak. When the Farris family reached the city, they found the couple had not made it back. Zach recounts one of Leila's stories, a fairytale of a travelling bird that sung as it flew over the jungle. He was loved by all, except the spider, whose webs and prey were disrupted by the songbird's passing. The spider made a web big enough to catch the bird, and ate well. At the [council](/_wiki/council.md), the investigation into [Aria's](/_wiki/aria.md) attempted assassination reports that it was done by a [Rasul](/_wiki/rasul.md). They vote to pass the [Rasul Identification Bill](/_wiki/rasul-identification-bill.md) in fear of it happening again.
