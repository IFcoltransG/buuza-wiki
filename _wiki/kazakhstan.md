Kazakhstan is the northernmost region of [Dawlat Al-Harir](/_wiki/dawlat-al-harir.md). [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) has lived here. [Zarina](/_wiki/zarina.md) is representative, and she lives there with [Sam's mother](/_wiki/sams-mother.md). Holds special festivities for [Al Basir](/_wiki/al-basir.md).

Borders [Eastern Turkistan](/_wiki/eastern-turkistan.md) and [Western Turkistan](/_wiki/western-turkistan.md) to the south.

It is of course a fictional region, and does not correspond exactly to the real world Kazakhstan.
