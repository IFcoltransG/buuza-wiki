Winged creatures sometimes fly across the border into [Dawlat Al-Harir](/_wiki/dawlat-al-harir.md), although sometimes it's migrants, specifically birds.

There is a jungle, supposedly cursed, on fertile soil that abuts the rural regions of Dawlat Al-Harir.

The 'New World', i.e. the Americas, are out there somewhere.
