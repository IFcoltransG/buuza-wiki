'The Juncture' is a chapter of the [comic](/_wiki/index.md), preceded by [Blue Hour](/_wiki/blue-hour.md) and followed by [Lost \[like a Winter Moon\]](/_wiki/lost-like-a-winter-moon.md).

## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/1671893)
[Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) buys the copy of [Bilquis](/_wiki/balqis.md) he owes [Rumeha](/_wiki/rumeha.md) and takes a train towards the [print shop](/_wiki/aa-xerox.md) she works at. On the way he sees [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) again.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/1671896)
Zach introduces himself and apologises to Musa about [Sam's](/_wiki/sam.md) behaviour when she insulted his family's honour at [Habibi's Diner](/_wiki/habibis.md). It turns out they are both going to [AA-Xerox](/_wiki/aa-xerox.md). After Zach gives the magazine to Rumeha, her colleague [Sabbah](/_wiki/sabbah.md) pulls her aside to question why Zach, who was previously Rumeha's [university](/_wiki/salwa-university.md) crush, and the very cute Musa, are visiting their print shop. She offers to help Musa copy notes, but only if they both take Sabbah and Rumeha to lunch. Musa and Rumeha are appalled.

## [Episode 3](https://tapas.io/episode/1671897)
Musa explains he is aromantic to Zach, and Zach reassures Musa that he is also gay, and promises to handle it. Instead, to Musa's horror, Zach accepts the offer, conditional on them both getting free printing ever after. Sabbah accepts, leading to Rumeha throwing all three of them out of the store. Musa still needs to print a floppy disk, but [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) who happens to be walking past offers to get it printed, as an apology to Musa. When Zach explains to Sabbah he's gay, she is annoyed he didn't say that a few minutes earlier.
