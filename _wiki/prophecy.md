When [Zarina](/_wiki/zarina.md) took power from her parent and ended the attempted Alikhanov revolution, she made the following prophecy, a curse on the [Al-Harir Dynasty](/_wiki/al-harir.md).

> When the new millenia dawns, and the sun and moon meetâ€”
>
> The song of [Birds](/_wiki/bird.md) will unravel the [country](/_wiki/dawlat-al-harir.md) of [spider silk](/_wiki/as-sami.md),
>
> And the Al-Harir Dynasty will fall to dark.

It's worth noting that the comic begins on New Year's Eve, 1997, wintertime.

This prophecy is the reason that [Bird religion](/_wiki/an-nur-and-al-hadi.md) is banned from Dawlat Al-Harir and immigration of birdfolk is restricted, because the Al Harir dynasty wishes to prevent the prophecy from ever eventuating.
