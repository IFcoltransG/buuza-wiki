## [Open Invitation](https://tapas.io/episode/1407297)
[Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) and [Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md) talk about themselves on the phone. Zhen [studied](/_wiki/university-of-eastern-turkistan.md) photography, and Zach used to study maths at [Salwa University](/_wiki/salwa-university.md). Zhen is surprised that Zach lives in [Salwa](/_wiki/salwa.md) in [Dilmun](/_wiki/dilmun.md). He lives far away in [Kashgar](/_wiki/kashgar.md), so they are both saddened that they won't be able to meet each other very easily.
