## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/2376513)
[Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) gets off the train from [Salwa](/_wiki/salwa.md) at [Shymkentnational Rail Station](/_wiki/shymkentnational-rail-station.md) with her motorcycle. [Zarina](/_wiki/zarina.md) bitterly invites her into an old palace.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/2376514)
Zarina calls Sam a disappointment for not attending family events, calling her weekly visits to the [Divine Oracle](/_wiki/aria.md) with prophecies the bare minimum. They eat without [Sam's mother](/_wiki/sams-mother.md), who has been ill lately. Zarina grieves her own mother, thinking of how far the family has fallen. She recounts how she had to take over when her parents' revolution against the [Al Harir](/_wiki/al-harir.md) dynasty failed, and how they stripped the family's history from them in punishment. Sam leaves Zarina to her pride, to take food to her sick mother.

## [Episode 3](https://tapas.io/episode/2376516)
Sam's mother is pleased to see her. They talk about Sam's father, and how Sam hasn't seen him in a long time to avoid Zarina's ire.

## [Episode 4](https://tapas.io/episode/2378451)
As Sam leaves, Zarina throws more disappointment at her from the old palace steps. Zarina calls [Aria](/_wiki/aria.md) a charlatan. Sam's temper breaks and she accuses Zarina of cowardice for giving up their family's revolution. Sam's mother interrupts, to say goodbye and give Sam a [morin khuur](/_wiki/morin-khuur-instrument.md) she made.
