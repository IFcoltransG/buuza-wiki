Zarina Alikhanov is representative of [Kazakhstan](/_wiki/kazakhstan.md) and leader of the tribe of [Al Basir](/_wiki/al-basir.md). A deer. Grandmother of [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md). She boasts a scar from a failed deer revolution that took place when she was young. She surrendered the revolution after she took power from her parent, but in doing so cursed the [Al Harir Dynasty](/_wiki/al-harir.md) with a [prophecy](/_wiki/prophecy.md). She swore to uphold the lie that only those blessed by [As-Sami](/_wiki/as-sami.md) can see the future, rather than Al Basir, in exchange for the lives of [her daughter](/_wiki/sams-mother.md) and Sam.
