[Dawlat Al-Harir](wiki/Dawlat%20al-harir.md) is a theocracy that acknowledges ten gods, to varying degrees. Each god aligns with a particular animal, and they bless the [Rasul](wiki/rasul.md), a subset of the population, with the ability to transform into one of those creatures. Followers of each god have different customs and ways of worshipping. The gods' names (in the order they appear on [Deathhead](wiki/deathhead.md) cards) follows:
## Autumn
- [As Sami](wiki/as-sami.md) (spider, sister of Al Basir)
- [Al Basir](wiki/al-basir.md) (deer, brother of As Sami)
## Summer
- [Al Muqit and Al Ba'ith](wiki/al-muqit-and-al-baith.md) (cats)
- [Al Mu'min](wiki/al-mumin.md) (cat or dog, consort of Al 'Adl)
## Winter
- [Al 'Adl](wiki/al-adl.md) (rabbit, has Al Mu'min as consort)
- [An Nur and Al Hadi](wiki/an-nur-and-al-hadi.md) ([[Bird|birds]])
## Spring
- [Al Khaaliq](wiki/al-khaaliq.md) (ram)
- [Al Muhyi](wiki/al-muhyi.md) (moth or butterfly)

While their names are drawn from the names of Allah in real-world Islam, [the comic](wiki/README.md) is not about Islam itself.

Prayer to the gods is used in [greenscharming](wiki/greenscharming.md).
