'Summersets / Side B' is a chapter of the [comic](/_wiki/index.md), preceded by [The Long Summer](/_wiki/the-long-summer.md) and followed by [Summersets / Side A](/_wiki/summersets-side-a.md).

## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/2660349)
[Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) is doing her hair, shaving her arms and legs, and getting into her [Ahl Vahid](/_wiki/ahl-vahid.md) dress, while [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) looks on. [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) arrives and they walk to the train station, having organised their cars to arrive at the palace in [Abu Eankabut](/_wiki/abu-eankabut.md) at different times to avoid suspicions that they know each other. Zach, alone, makes tea and food, going up to the roof to eat it.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/2661435)
Zach sits on the roof overlooking the sunset, when his phone rings. [Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md) apologises for not calling and taking Zach for granted, having tried to call before but getting a disconnected number. Zhen says he will speak to his family (Musa and [Miriam](/_wiki/miriam.md)) in the future.

## [Episode 3](https://tapas.io/episode/2661436)
Zach tells Zhen about what's been going on at work with [Cid](/_wiki/cid-al-rashid.md), and Zhen tells Zach to quit. He tells Zach it's alright that he doesn't know what he wants to do, he can take it one step at a time and depend on the people around him: Sam and Musa. Zach tries to tell Zhen he loves him, but Zhen tells him to save those words for when they're standing in front of each other, and they can embrace each other. He promises to go to Zach.
