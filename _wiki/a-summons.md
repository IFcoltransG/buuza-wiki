'A Summons' is a chapter of the [comic](/_wiki/index.md), preceded by [Silent Songs](/_wiki/silent-songs.md) and followed by [The End of Spring](/_wiki/the-end-of-spring.md).

## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/2264863)
[Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) embroiders and discusses praying every day. [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) wonders aloud if all the [gods](/_wiki/gods.md) are dead or never existed. [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) gets a package, but leaves it to Musa and Zach to open.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/2264865)
Musa and Zach are in awe of the dress in the package, an [Ahl Vahid](/_wiki/ahl-vahid.md) original (the one [Aria](/_wiki/aria.md) asked Sam about). Zach sheds a tear to see its beauty in the flesh. They demand Sam put it on. After she does, Musa checks who sent the dress, seeing it addressed to Samantha [Aibekovna](/_wiki/aibek.md) Alikhanov and finally recognising her.

## [Episode 3](https://tapas.io/episode/2264868)
Musa explains to Zach that Sam is from a more prestigious bloodline than Musa's, and heir to a holy family. Sam rages against the family she never asked for, who took her from her father as soon as they realised she would be valuable to them. She rejects the dress, representing a summons by her [grandmother](/_wiki/zarina.md) and [mother](/_wiki/sams-mother.md) back to a life she does not want. Musa gets angry at her for disregarding her family even though they are still alive, a luxury Musa does not have.

## [Episode 4](https://tapas.io/episode/2264870)
[Emira](/_wiki/emira.md) tells Aria they have [discovered](/_wiki/a-family-portrait.md) the name of [Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md) and that he is in [Kashgar](/_wiki/kashgar.md), who asks them to leak the information to the press. [Miriam](/_wiki/miriam.md) arrives and reports four unidentified flying objects crossing the border from [outside of Dalwat Al-Harir](/_wiki/outside-of-dalwat-al-harir.md), either creatures, or more concerningly, undocumented migrants ([Birds](/_wiki/bird.md)). [Emira](/_wiki/emira.md) believes Birds are leaving the cities for rural areas, so there is no threat. When Aria asks for information on Sam's new roommate, Emira demands more money for that information.

## [Episode 5](https://tapas.io/episode/2264873)
Aria threatens to destroy Emira, but they call their bluff. Aria sends them away, but agrees to consider buying the information. Miriam teases Aria about Birds being a cult of dead [gods](/_wiki/gods.md). Aria doesn't want his sisters stepping in or a religious revolution.
