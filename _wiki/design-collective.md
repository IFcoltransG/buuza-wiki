A fashion and design collective near [Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md)'s photography store, in [Kashgar](/_wiki/kashgar.md). [Reyhan](/_wiki/reyhan.md) is their designer. Zhen is their photographer. [Bai Ju](/_wiki/bai-ju.md) their model (although she also hems). [Ilham](/_wiki/ilham.md) is their pattern cutter for textiles. [Patime](/_wiki/patime.md) used to be their photographer and stylist, until she left because of a fight with Bai Ju, her partner. Reyhan and Ju took over the styling after that. It can't pay much, and requires a lot of work, but is emotionally rewarding. Reyhan and Ju put in effort to network and get the collective's name known.
