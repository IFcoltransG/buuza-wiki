Works with [Rumeha](/_wiki/rumeha.md) at a [print shop](/_wiki/aa-xerox.md) in [Salwa](/_wiki/salwa.md). Made a zine about secular government reform.

Sabbah is involved in a political group at [Salwa University](/_wiki/salwa-university.md). [Nithiya](/_wiki/nithiya.md) reminisces that when she herself went to university, an underground rebel ground made a huge kerfuffle, potentially the same group or similar to what Sabbah is in now.
