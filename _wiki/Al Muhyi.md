Al Muhyi (they/them) is a [deity](wiki/Gods.md), but even though their card gives [Deathhead](wiki/Deathhead.md) its name, they are not a death god. A moth or butterfly. It's not clear who is the death god, but it's not Al Muhyi, neither is it [An Nur or Al Hadi](wiki/An%20Nur%20and%20Al%20Hadi.md).
