## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/1746273)
[Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) loses to [Aria](/_wiki/aria.md) at [Deathhead](/_wiki/deathhead.md), who asks what Sam thinks of a designer dress in a catalogue. Sam heads off, refusing Aria's offer for her to move into the palace some time to avoid having to work her job.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/1746274)
[Miriam](/_wiki/miriam.md) springs out from behind a pillar, hoping to catch a skulker about the palace, but only finds Sam. Sam tells her she met [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) recently, who didn't recognise her. She offers condolences about the revelation about [Miriam's mother](/_wiki/musas-mother.md). Sam meets up with [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md), who is all dressed up to leave.

## [Episode 3](https://tapas.io/episode/1746276)
Zach discusses the fundamentals of soap operas with Sam as they walk to [Habibi's Diner](/_wiki/habibis.md). Musa is waiting outside holding a potted plant. He gives the plant to them both in gratitude, and as an apology for misjudging them. Zach invites Musa to dinner with them. He explains the soap opera to Musa. Sam embarrasses herself again by making a big deal of whether Musa can hear her with his hearing aids â€” Musa can hear her fine.

## [Episode 4](https://tapas.io/episode/1746277)
The news comes on, and Musa talks about always being in the press, because the Farris's are a rags-to-riches immigrant family that is now successful, provoking tall poppy syndrome from the masses. Musa hopes they will find [Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md) someday, and asks if either of them know someone with that name. Zach lies. Musa carries the plant home for them, revealing that he spent the whole week there, hoping to catch them. Zach gives Musa an open invitation to visit the flat any time, which embarrasses Sam again.
