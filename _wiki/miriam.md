The people's elected official, overseeing civil law about the non-[council](wiki/council.md) ministries. Heiress to the [Chevalier Business Conglomerate](wiki/chevalier-business-conglomerate.md). She's gay. Her two assistants are [Farrah](wiki/Farrah) and [Zeynep](wiki/Zeynep). She would like [Sam](wiki/sam.md) to be more involved in politics, believing that Sam could make a real difference, because of her situation.

She claims she ran for office to take responsibility for making the country better.

She commissions a painted portrait of the family, including their deceased parents, from [Mr Wahed](wiki/Mr%20Wahed), now that it is seven years after their passing.

Her and Musa's family's gods are [Al Muqit and Al Ba'ith](wiki/al-muqit-and-al-baith.md), cat gods.
