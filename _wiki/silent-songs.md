'Silent Songs' is a chapter of the [comic](/_wiki/index.md), preceded by [The Perfect Gift](/_wiki/the-perfect-gift.md) and followed by [A Summons](/_wiki/a-summons.md).

## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/2205625)
[Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) buys a copy of [Meissa](/_wiki/meissa-magazine.md), the magazine in which [Zhen's](/_wiki/zhen.md) [design collective](/_wiki/design-collective.md) was selected for a feature. He then heads to [AA-Xerox](/_wiki/aa-xerox.md) to read it. [Sabbah](/_wiki/sabbah.md) picks up some zines from the print shop, to raise awareness for a uni society campaigning for secular government reform with other activists. Zach takes a zine and leaves for dinner at [Habibi's Diner](/_wiki/habibis.md) with [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) and [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md), to begin a new Thursday tradition now that they don't need to use the TV there. Musa doubts that the zine is right about needing reform, but Sam claims the government is corrupt, excepting [Miriam](/_wiki/miriam.md).

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/2205626)
Zach is confused about what Miriam does in government, what a prime minister is, and how that fits in with [Dawlat Al-Harir](/_wiki/dawlat-al-harir.md) being an autocratic theocracy under [the Divine Oracle](/_wiki/aria.md). Musa explains [Al Harir](/_wiki/al-harir.md) dynasty, the sect representatives on the [council](/_wiki/council.md), the prime minister Miriam, and the minor ministry leaders. Musa uses the map from the zine to explain regional leaders. Musa counters Sam's complaint that each leader is nepotist and selfish with the argument that every sect is represented. They realise that [Bird folk](/_wiki/bird.md) don't have a representative, unlike the other sects.
