'It's Faster With Two' is a chapter of the [comic](/_wiki/index.md), preceded by [Heaven Lies Beneath](/_wiki/heaven-lies-beneath.md) and followed by [A Family Portrait](/_wiki/a-family-portrait.md).

## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/2044125)
[Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) brings [suutei tsai](/_wiki/suutei-tsai.md) tea to [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) as she works on tidying the vegetation around the [soon-to-be diner](/_wiki/buuza-mongolian-diner.md), which goes much better than the [last time](/_wiki/backwash.md) Sam tried a beverage Zach had made. Sam invites Zach to help her [bless](/_wiki/greenscharming.md) the ground, because the more [Rasul](/_wiki/rasul.md) help, the longer it takes weeds to regrow. Zach doubts he can help, but does so anyway. At the end of chanting the blessing together, both have traces of magic visible around them.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/2044127)
Sam goes to mop the floor so it can be tiled the next day. Zach helps dry. Sam says the diner is her biggest goal, the thing that makes her happy; Zach thinks of [Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md).
