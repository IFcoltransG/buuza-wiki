Zach Kartal (he/him) rooms with [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md). Friends with [Harshul](/_wiki/harshul.md), and both of them work for [Cid](/_wiki/cid.md) taking sex-line phone calls. Harshul used to be his flatmate, and they would watch soap operas together, until their flat's boiler exploded. Friends with [Emira](/_wiki/emira.md). [Cid](/_wiki/cid.md) is his ex and boss. From [Konstantinyye](/_wiki/konstantinyye.md) originally. He has a big collection of pulp graphic novels, such as 'Curse of the Jackalope: The Terror from the New World'.

Can make [manti](/_wiki/manti.md), which he learnt from [his mother](/_wiki/leila.md), who is a [Bird](/_wiki/bird.md). His father is not; he barely remembers [his father](/_wiki/Zach's%20father). He drinks coffee with no sugar. His favourite colour is green, and his favourite food is lamb chops. (Although his mother thinks his favourite is firinda sutlac.)

His work number is 965-6969-777. After [Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md) called that number mistakenly, the two fell in love. He first met [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) at [Habibi's](/_wiki/habibis.md), then later they both met [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) there.

He studied mathematics for a year in [Salwa University](/_wiki/salwa-university.md), which [Rumeha](/_wiki/rumeha.md) also attended. He is 21 years old.

He watches soaps like 'Beautific Generation' and 'The Poet'. He's also trans and demisexual. [Emira](/_wiki/emira.md) calls him 'weird bird' or 'bird boy'.
