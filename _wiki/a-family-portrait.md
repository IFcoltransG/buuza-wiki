## [Episode 3](https://tapas.io/episode/2080691)
Miriam tells Musa that she didn't say anything about it because Musa was only thirteen at the time; she overheard their mother and [father](/_wiki/musas-father.md) fighting about Zhen, and they told her. She tells Musa that Huang Zhen was the son of their mother and a business partner she had an affair with in [East Turkistan](/_wiki/eastern-turkistan.md) 24 years ago. She tells Musa their mother gave Zhen up for the sake of appearances. Miriam says their parents were never perfect and they wronged Zhen; Musa says its now their responsibility to fix it, but Miriam isn't sure he would want to be found. A cat watches the conversation from the window, possibly one known to [Emira](/_wiki/emira.md).
