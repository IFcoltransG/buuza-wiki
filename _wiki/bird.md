Birds are a religious sect that follows [An Nur and Al Hadi](/_wiki/an-nur-and-al-hadi.md). Many bird [Rasul](/_wiki/rasul.md) can transform into birds. Birds are the only sect without a holy family and representative. The [Al Harir](/_wiki/al-harir.md) dynasty attempted to erase the practice of Bird religion from [Dawlat Al-Harir](/_wiki/dawlat-al-harir.md) due to its involvement in a [prophecy](/_wiki/prophecy.md), and restrict passage to Bird migrants to the country.

Many groups of Birdfolk are moving away from Dalwat Al-Harir's cities due to persecution. A practitioner selling Bird scriptures at the [sooq](/_wiki/sooq.md) was asked to shut down his stall by the sooq administration, because of a lack of interest. The [Bird mosque](/_wiki/bird-mosque.md) that [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) and [Leila](/_wiki/leila.md) visit is hidden away in an unassuming building.

[The Al-Harir sisters](/_wiki/arias-sisters.md) return to [Abu Eankabut](/_wiki/abu-eankabut.md) from their ancestral home because they are concerned about undocumented Bird migrants as a threat to national security.
