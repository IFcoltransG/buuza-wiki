At the palace in [Abu Eankabut](/_wiki/abu-eankabut.md), [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) arrives, with [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) already talking to her Rabbit relatives on bodyguard duty. [Cid](/_wiki/cid-al-rashid.md) and Musa pass each other without either noticing. Sam and Musa complain about the party to each other. Musa gets upset by other people seeminly talking about them behind their back, and Sam decides to share her own gossip about [Lady Alikhanov](/_wiki/zarina.md) and [her daughter](/_wiki/sams-mother.md), that her daughter had an affair with one of her bodyguards, with Sam being their kid. This is a state secret. [Miriam](/_wiki/miriam.md) arrives, so Musa departs to avoid suspicion.

Miriam tells Sam that she stepped up to the business and political mantles after [her parents](/_wiki/musas-mother.md) died in order to take responsibility, both for her family, and for fixing something wrong with the [country](/_wiki/dawlat-al-harir.md). Miriam tells her that Sam is wasting her chance to make a change by revealing her secret, out of cowardice. Miriam says other people are willing to do what it takes to change the country, but at that moment Sam gets a premonition, as [Aria](/_wiki/aria.md) is about to give their speech.

## [Episode 3](https://tapas.io/episode/2661439)
Sam, terrified of what she saw, flees from the conversation with Miriam through the palace, until Zarina Alikhanov stops her. She shakes Zarina off, telling her that Aria is in trouble. As Aria begins his speech from a balcony, Sam throws some plates to the ground as a warning to them. The balcony collapses.

The crowd is dismayed, and in the chaos Sam runs to a side passage, clutching Aria in his spider form (who has teleported to her for safety). When Sam has magically confirmed that whoever caused the collapse won't try again, Aria teleports to another balcony and reassures the guests that they are alive, calling the party to an immediate close.
