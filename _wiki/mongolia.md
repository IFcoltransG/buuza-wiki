Where [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) grew up and learnt to make [buuza](/_wiki/buuza-dish.md), the food. Seemingly [outside of Dalwat Al-Harir](/_wiki/outside-of-dalwat-al-harir.md). Possibly contains [Tsenkher Springs](/_wiki/tsenkher-springs.md). Likely celebrates the moon festival for [Al 'Adl](/_wiki/al-adl.md) along with [Eastern Turkistan](/_wiki/eastern-turkistan.md).

It is of course a fictional place, and does not correspond exactly to the real world Mongolia.
