'Morin Khuur' is a chapter of the [comic](/_wiki/index.md), preceded by [The End of Spring](/_wiki/the-end-of-spring.md) and followed by [Cid](/_wiki/cid.md).

## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/2450879)
It is summer Eid, and [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) asks [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) to give him some reminders of how to pray. Musa doesn't know the specifics of [Bird](/_wiki/bird.md) religious practices, and Zach wishes [Leila](/_wiki/leila.md) was there to help. [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) returns and Musa reconciles with her.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/2450886)
Musa regrets not being able to shout at his parents, and is glad Sam got that opportunity. Sam opens the [morin khuur](/_wiki/morin-khuur-instrument.md) that [her mother](/_wiki/sams-mother.md) gave her, which has a jackalope carved into the head. She plays a song which Musa and Zach dance to.
