[Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) collects donations outside [Habibi's Diner](/_wiki/habibis.md). [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) and [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) donate. Zach and Sam start a conversation in the diner. Zach tries to pay for the meal using donations, to Sam's anger.

Sam chases Zach into the street. Zach loses his business cards, which Sam discovers are for a phone sexline. Zach prints new ones at [AA-Xerox](/_wiki/aa-xerox.md), and takes [Rumeha's](/_wiki/rumeha.md) donation bucket in exchange for a future copy of [Balqis](/_wiki/balqis.md).

## [Episode 3](https://tapas.io/episode/1278141)
Zach returns home. He and [Harshul](/_wiki/harshul.md) complain about the boiler and [Cid](/_wiki/cid.md) not paying either of them yet. Zach gets a call on his sexline phone from [Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md) asking for emergency services.

## [Episode 4](https://tapas.io/episode/1278143)
Zhen says he needs to talk through something awful he learnt that morning. Zach tells him that Zhen has rung a sexline, not the [Sacred Star Charity](/_wiki/sacred-star-charity.md) Emergency Help Line like he thought, but he wants to help Zhen through his distress. Zhen tells Zach that his family has a secret that his father doesn't want anyone to know about. Zach tells Zhen his name, but Zhen's name is cut off by New Year's fireworks and Zhen's payphone disconnecting.
