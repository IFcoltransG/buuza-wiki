[Bird](/_wiki/bird.md) [goddesses](/_wiki/gods.md) associated with winter. Supposedly dead gods, persecuted by the [Al Harir dynasty](/_wiki/al-harir.md). Not gods of death though. Have no holy family, unlike most [Rasul](/_wiki/rasul.md) groups.

It's not clear who is the death god, but it's neither of them, nor [Al Muhyi](/_wiki/al-muhyi.md).

An Nur's followers pray at Fajr, like the followers of [Al 'Mumin](/_wiki/al-mumin.md). Followers of Al Hadi usually pray at Mahgrib.
