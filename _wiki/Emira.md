When [Harshul](wiki/harshul.md) told [Zach](wiki/zach.md) to come to them for a lead on a flat, they sent [Zach](wiki/zach.md) to [Nithiya](wiki/nithiya.md), who they are friends with.

Emira overheard information about [Zhen](wiki/zhen.md) from Miriam and [Musa](wiki/musa.md) at [Nya-Nyails](wiki/nya-nyails.md), which [Aria](wiki/aria.md) told them to eventually leak to the media, partially in order to deter Miriam from looking for Zhen.
