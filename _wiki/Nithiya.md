Nithiya owns the second-floor flat [Sam](wiki/Sam.md) and [Zach](wiki/Zach.md) live in, as well as the room she lets [Sam](wiki/Sam.md) renovate and use. She is pious: she got her girlfriend [Saesha](wiki/Saesha) to install a speaker that plays the Azaan prayer each morning.

She may know about Sam's identity, because she asks about her rich friends and calls her '[Aibekovna](wiki/Aibek)' rather than just Aibek.

Nithiya is firm in matters of business, and knows [Emira](wiki/Emira.md).
