'Lazy Saturday' is a chapter of the [comic](/_wiki/index.md), preceded by [In the Land of Spider Silk](/_wiki/in-the-land-of-spider-silk.md) and followed by [Nighthawks 1](/_wiki/nighthawks-1.md).

## [Lazy Saturday](https://tapas.io/episode/1600511)
[Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) and [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) give up on assembling furniture to go to the [laundromat](/_wiki/laundry-24.md) and to shop. They get fruit, and Zach buys a skirt for himself that risks compromising the factual, objective tone of this summary because of how good it looks on him. The skirt objectively has [pockets](/_wiki/silent-songs.md). Zach explains that he stole his jacket from someone he knew, a [bad person](/_wiki/cid-al-rashid.md).
