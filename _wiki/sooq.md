The sooq is market, in [Dilmun](/_wiki/dilmun.md), where [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md), [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) and [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) go. [Harshul](/_wiki/harshul.md) recommends shops on the East Wing of it. It has a train station nearby. The administration shuts down a stall selling [Bird](/_wiki/bird.md) scriptures due to complaints, given most of the city (presumably [Salwa](/_wiki/salwa.md)) is not interested in Bird lore.
