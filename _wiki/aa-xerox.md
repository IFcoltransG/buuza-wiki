AA-Xerox is a print shop in [Salwa](wiki/salwa.md) that does printing, copying and fax. [Zach](wiki/zach.md) got his business cards reprinted from there when he lost them escaping from [Sam](wiki/sam.md). Zach and [Musa](wiki/musa.md) went there on their second meeting (technically their third, if counting Musa donating to Zach's collection bucket outside [Habibi's](wiki/habibis.md)) because Musa needed to print his university work. [Sabbah](wiki/sabbah.md) and [Rumeha](wiki/rumeha.md) work there.
