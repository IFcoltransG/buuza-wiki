AA-Xerox is a print shop in [Salwa](/_wiki/salwa.md) that does printing, copying and fax. [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) got his business cards reprinted from there when he lost them escaping from [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md). Zach and [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) went there on their second meeting (technically their third, if counting Musa donating to Zach's collection bucket outside [Habibi's](/_wiki/habibis.md)) because Musa needed to print his university work. [Sabbah](/_wiki/sabbah.md) and [Rumeha](/_wiki/rumeha.md) work there.
