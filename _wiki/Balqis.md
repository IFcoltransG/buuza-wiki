A fashion magazine that [Zhen](wiki/zhen.md)'s collective got into (along with [Meissa Magazine](wiki/Meissa%20Magazine)). [Rumeha](wiki/rumeha.md) asked for a copy from [Zach](wiki/zach.md) in exchange for replacing his collection bucket, after he lost his running from [Sam](wiki/sam.md). Zach gives a copy to Rumeha later, when [Musa](wiki/musa.md) first comes to [the print shop](wiki/aa-xerox.md). Issues cost somewhere around 0.99 dinars.
