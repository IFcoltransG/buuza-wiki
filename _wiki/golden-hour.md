## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/3104214)
[Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md) tells [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) over the phone about his week. He modelled a some clothes for the [design collective](/_wiki/design-collective.md), with [Ju](/_wiki/ju.md) taking the photo. She had been studying how Zhen takes photos, and thinks she might take up photography if modelling doesn't work for her. As Ju and Zhen leave the workshop, a reporter shows them the fashion magazine that gave Zhen a photographer credit, asking if Huang Zhen is the long lost sibling of [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) and [Miriam](/_wiki/miriam.md). The reporter seems [confident](/_wiki/a-summons.md) that Zhen is, despite his denials. Zhen runs from the reporter, and he and Ju jump a fence to escape.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/3115007)
Zach points out that the press now have Zhen's rough location, even if they don't know where he lives or works. Musa interrupts the phone call and invites Zach and Sam to a celebratory dinner on Friday. Over tea, Zach tells Musa about his friend on the phone, and how it's been going on for about nine months. When Zach reveals that he lives in [Kashgar](/_wiki/kashgar.md), Musa is ecstatic, having learnt from [Miriam](/_wiki/miriam.md) that Zhen lives there. Musa starts trying to arrange a trip with Zach to Kashgar, so that Musa can look for Zhen, and Zach can meet up with Zhen (not knowing they're the same person). Zach becomes lost in thought while Musa talks about the plan.
