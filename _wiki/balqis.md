A fashion magazine that [Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md)'s collective got into (along with [Meissa Magazine](/_wiki/meissa-magazine.md)). [Rumeha](/_wiki/rumeha.md) asked for a copy from [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) in exchange for replacing his collection bucket, after he lost his running from [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md). Zach gives a copy to Rumeha later, when [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) first comes to [the print shop](/_wiki/aa-xerox.md). Issues cost somewhere around 0.99 dinars.
