A magazine, also called 'Balqis'. [Rumeha](/_wiki/rumeha.md) asked for a copy from [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) in exchange for replacing his collection bucket, after he lost his own running from [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md). Zach gives a copy to Rumeha later, when [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) first comes to [the print shop](/_wiki/aa-xerox.md). Issues cost somewhere around 0.99 dinars.
