[Bird](wiki/Bird) [goddesses](wiki/Gods.md) associated with winter. Supposedly dead gods, persecuted. Not gods of death though. Have no holy family, and are different from most [Rasul](wiki/Rasul.md).

It's not clear who is the death god, but it's neither of them, nor [Al Muhyi](wiki/Al%20Muhyi.md).

An Nur's followers pray at Fajr, like the followers of [Al 'Mumin](wiki/Al%20Mumin.md). Followers of Al Hadi usually pray at Mahgrib.
