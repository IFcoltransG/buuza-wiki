The council of representatives sits below [Aria](wiki/aria.md) in the rulership of [Dawlat Al-Harir](wiki/Dawlat%20al-harir.md). Every religious sect has their holy family and representative, except for [Birds](wiki/Bird).
[Miriam](wiki/miriam.md) is there too, but not as a regional or religious representative: she is the prime minister.
[Abdi](wiki/abdi.md) is a cat person.
[Mahedi](wiki/Mahedi) is in charge of security, saying [Nurul](wiki/Nurul), [Sonam](wiki/Sonam) and [Aibek](wiki/Aibek) pledged personnel towards it.
[Esfahani](wiki/esfahani.md) is also there, representing [Parsi](wiki/parsi.md).
[Shakur](wiki/shakur.md) represents [Rajastan](wiki/rajastan.md).

The council also appoints ministers, such as for trade, health and education.
