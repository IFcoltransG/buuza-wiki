Nithiya owns the second-floor flat [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) and [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) live in, as well as the room she lets [Sam](/_wiki/sam.md) renovate and use. She is pious: she got her girlfriend [Saesha](/_wiki/saesha.md) to install a speaker that plays the Azaan prayer each morning.

She may know about Sam's identity, because she asks about her rich friends and calls her '[Aibekovna](/_wiki/aibek.md)' rather than just Aibek.

Nithiya is firm in matters of business, and knows [Emira](/_wiki/emira.md).
