title: Sooq

The sooq is market, in [Dilmun](wiki/dilmun.md), where [Musa](wiki/musa.md), [Zach](wiki/zach.md) and [Sam](wiki/sam.md) go. [Harshul](wiki/harshul.md) recommends shops on the East Wing of it. It has a train station nearby. The administration shuts down a stall selling [Bird](wiki/Bird) scriptures due to complaints, given most of the city (presumably [Salwa](wiki/salwa.md)) is not interested in Bird lore.
