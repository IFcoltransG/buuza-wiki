## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/2559280)
[Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md) is upset about [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) and messes up fabric he's sewing for the [design collective](/_wiki/design-collective.md). [Ju](/_wiki/ju.md) compares the fabric, [Zhen's dad](/_wiki/zhens-father.md), the [Farris](/_wiki/musa.md) [siblings](/_wiki/miriam.md), and [the boy on the telephone](/_wiki/zach.md): in each case, if something isn't how he likes it, he gives up on the whole thing. She demonstrates her point by salvaging some of the fabric.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/2559281)
Ju confronts Zhen about his work getting sloppy because he's upset about his personal drama. Zhen storms off, but tells Ju she's right as he leaves. He goes to a payphone to call Zach, but the number is not connected.
