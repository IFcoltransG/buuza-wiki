[Abdi](wiki/Abdi.md) is a cat person.
[Mahedi](wiki/Mahedi) is in charge of security, saying [Nurul](wiki/Nurul), [Sonam](wiki/Sonam) and [Aibek](wiki/Aibek) pledged personnel towards it.
[Esfahani](wiki/Esfahani.md) is also there, representing [Parsi](wiki/Parsi.md).
[Shakur](wiki/Shakur.md) represents [Rajastan](wiki/Rajastan.md).

The council also appoints ministers, such as for trade, health and education.
