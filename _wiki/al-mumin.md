Seemingly a cat [god](/_wiki/gods.md) (like [Al Muqit and Al Ba'ith](/_wiki/al-muqit-and-al-baith.md)) associated with summer, or perhaps a dog god. Al Mu'min's followers pray at Fajr, like the followers of [An Nur](/_wiki/an-nur-and-al-hadi.md).

Al Mu'min may be the consort of [Al 'Adl](/_wiki/al-adl.md).
