Seemingly a cat [god](wiki/gods.md) (like [Al Muqit and Al Ba'ith](wiki/al-muqit-and-al-baith.md)) associated with summer, or perhaps a dog god. Al Mu'min's followers pray at Fajr, like the followers of [An Nur](wiki/an-nur-and-al-hadi.md).

Al Mu'min may be the consort of [Al 'Adl](wiki/al-adl.md).
