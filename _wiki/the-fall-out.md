'The Fall Out' is a chapter of the [comic](/_wiki/index.md), preceded by [Summersets / Side A](/_wiki/summersets-side-a.md) and followed by [BUUZA!!](/_wiki/buuza.md).

## [Episode 1](https://tapas.io/episode/2750260)
[Ju](/_wiki/ju.md) and [Zhen](/_wiki/zhen.md) watch a news broadcast where [Miriam](/_wiki/miriam.md) describes that all council and holy family members are safe, but not all service staff have been accounted for. The reporter interrupts to ask questions about the [Divine Oracle Aria](/_wiki/aria.md). [Leila](/_wiki/leila.md), listening to the radio broadcast with [Nithiya](/_wiki/nithiya.md), brings up a rebel group that the newspaper thinks may have been responsible, which was active 10â€“15 years ago when Nithiya was in university. Leila worries that [Zach](/_wiki/zach.md) may have to live through the same tensions and conflicts she did. [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) returns and tells Zach that Sam is safe too, but that she won't be back in time to open [the diner](/_wiki/buuza-mongolian-diner.md) tomorrow.

## [Episode 2](https://tapas.io/episode/2750267)
Sam and Aria get out of bed together the morning after the attack, Aria rushing to get dressed because of [their sisters'](/_wiki/arias-sisters.md) imminent arrival. [Spider](/_wiki/as-sami.md) priests open a web portal through which the sisters arrive.

## [Episode 3](https://tapas.io/episode/2750272)
Sam standing beside Aria does not bow to the sisters, and one of them aims to scratch across her face as punishment. [Zarina](/_wiki/zarina.md) attempts to intercede for her granddaughter, but Aria instead steps in front of the blow, which catches their arm. Aria says there is no need for Sam to be punished.

## [Episode 4](https://tapas.io/episode/2750278)
Aria reveals that Sam saved her life, and that she will not be punished. Sam and Aria go to another room, where Sam changes out of her party get-up to go home. She confronts Aria about their secret relationship, saying she can't do it. She leaves the [holy island](/_wiki/abu-eankabut.md).

## [Episode 5](https://tapas.io/episode/3062744)
Aria's sisters tell them to give up on Sam, presenting a stack of other potential suitors instead. They bring up the [Bird Folk](/_wiki/bird.md) sightings in the city, and how important it is to keep them away. They tell him to use his power to see the moment when [Zarina](/_wiki/zarina.md) gave up her parents' revolution and agreed with the [Al-Harir dynasty](/_wiki/al-harir.md) to keep their secret, in exchange for her family (her [daughter](/_wiki/sams-mother.md) and granddaughter Sam). They see her covered in blood, face newly wounded, holding a baby, cursing and prophesying the [downfall of the Al-Harir dynasty](/_wiki/prophecy.md), naming Bird Folk in the prophecy. Aria doubts the prophecy will eventuate, given the steps already taken to prevent it. The sisters pass Aria a dossier with a proposal to resolve the Bird situation. Meanwhile, Sam returns to Zach, carrying her [morin khuur](/_wiki/morin-khuur-instrument.md) to cheer him up; he hugs her knowing she's safe back home.
