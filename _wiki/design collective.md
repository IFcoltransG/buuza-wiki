A fashion and design collective near [Zhen](wiki/Zhen.md)'s photography store, in [Kashgar](wiki/Kashgar.md). [Reyhan](wiki/Reyhan.md) is their designer. Zhen is their photographer. [Bai Ju](wiki/Bai%20Ju.md) their model (although she also hems). [Ilham](wiki/Ilham) is their pattern cutter for textiles. [Patime](wiki/Patime.md) used to be their photographer and stylist, until she left because of a fight with Bai Ju, her partner. Reyhan and Ju took over the styling after that. It can't pay much, and requires a lot of work, but is emotionally rewarding. Reyhan and Ju put in effort to network and get the collective's name known.
