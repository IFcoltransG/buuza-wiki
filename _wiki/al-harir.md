Most members of the ruling dynasty of [Dawlat Al-Harir](/_wiki/dawlat-al-harir.md) (the Al-Harir dynasty) live outside its borders, in their ancestral home. Senior members of the family appoint an oracle, [Aria](/_wiki/aria.md), to rule it. After [Zarina's](/_wiki/zarina.md) family's failed revolution against Al Harir, Zarina [prophesied](/_wiki/prophecy.md) the downfall of the dynasty.

Aria and their [sisters](/_wiki/arias-sisters.md) are members of the Al Harir family.
