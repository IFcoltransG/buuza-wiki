These cat [goddesses](/_wiki/gods.md) are celebrated officially, and associated with summer (although they have officially recognised sermons in autumn). Possibly represented by [Abdi](/_wiki/abdi.md).
Al Ba'ith is a medicine god. Al Muqit is apparently associated with baking and cooking. Al Muqit and Al Ba'ith are siblings who would use their hands to cook and to heal, respectively. With this framing, [Musa's mother](/_wiki/musas-mother.md) entreated her children [Musa](/_wiki/musa.md) and [Miriam](/_wiki/miriam.md) to love their hands as gifts and care for their hands as tools to make a better world â€” as justification for taking them to [Nya-Nyails](/_wiki/nya-nyails.md).

A greeting spoken to cat [Rasul](/_wiki/rasul.md) goes "As-salamu alaykum Rasul min Al Ba'ith", to which the reply is "Wa alaykumu as-salam".
