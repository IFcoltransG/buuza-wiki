# Balqis
A fashion magazine that [Zhen](wiki/Person/Zhen.md)'s collective got into (along with [Meissa Magazine](wiki/Meissa%20Magazine)). [Rumeha](wiki/Person/Rumeha.md) asked for a copy from [Zach](wiki/Person/Zach.md) in exchange for replacing his collection bucket, after he lost his running from [Sam](wiki/Person/Sam.md). Zach gives a copy to Rumeha later, when [Musa](wiki/Person/Musa.md) first comes to [the print shop](wiki/Location/Commercial/AA-Xerox.md). Issues cost somewhere around 0.99 dinars.
