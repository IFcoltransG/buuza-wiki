# AA-Xerox
AA-Xerox is a print shop in [Salwa](wiki/Location/Salwa.md) that does printing, copying and fax. [Zach](wiki/Person/Zach.md) got his business cards reprinted from there when he lost them escaping from [Sam](wiki/Person/Sam.md). Zach and [Musa](wiki/Person/Musa.md) went there on their second meeting (technically their third, if counting Musa donating to Zach's collection bucket outside [Habibi's](wiki/Location/Commercial/Habibis.md)) because Musa needed to print his university work. [Sabbah](wiki/Person/Sabbah.md) and [Rumeha](wiki/Person/Rumeha.md) work there.
