Works with [Sabbah](Person/Sabbah.md) at [AA-Xerox](Location/Commercial/AA-Xerox.md) in [Salwa](Location/Salwa.md). Had a crush on [Zach](Person/Zach.md) in first year of [university](Location/Education/Salwa%20University.md), so she might have studied mathematics or something similar. Now she's friends with him, albeit weary of his hijinks.
