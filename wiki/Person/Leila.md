A [Bird](wiki/Bird) [Rasul](wiki/Person/Group/Rasul.md), Zach's mother Leila moved to [Salwa](wiki/Location/Salwa.md) to be closer to her son, [Zach](wiki/Person/Zach.md), and support him in his studies. She used to watch soap operas and dramas with her son over breakfast. She is currently watching 'The Poet', just like her son.

She believes in the full pantheon of gods, but not the divination of [Aria](wiki/Person/Aria.md).
