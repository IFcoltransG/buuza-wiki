# Sabbah
Works with [Rumeha](wiki/Person/Rumeha.md) at a [print shop](wiki/Location/Commercial/AA-Xerox.md) in [Salwa](wiki/Location/Salwa.md). Made a zine about secular government reform.

Sabbah is involved in a political group at [Salwa University](wiki/Location/Education/Salwa%20University.md). [Nithiya](wiki/Person/Nithiya.md) reminisces that when she herself went to university, an underground rebel ground made a huge kerfuffle, potentially the same group or similar to what Sabbah is in now.
