A magical subset of the population. For example, [Emira](wiki/Person/Emira.md), [Omar](wiki/Omar), [Zach](wiki/Person/Zach.md), [Sam](wiki/Person/Sam.md) and [Aria](wiki/Person/Aria.md). Only Rasul can see Sam's star charts, such as when she cheats at [Deathhead](wiki/Culture/Deathhead.md). Rasul can also turn into their respective animals, and perform other magics.
