A fashion magazine that [Zhen](Zhen.md)'s collective got into (along with [Meissa Magazine](Meissa%20Magazine)). [Rumeha](Rumeha.md) asked for a copy from [Zach](Zach.md) in exchange for replacing his collection bucket, after he lost his running from [Sam](Sam.md). Zach gives a copy to Rumeha later, when [Musa](Musa.md) first comes to [the print shop](AA-Xerox.md). Issues cost somewhere around 0.99 dinars.
