# Balqis
A fashion magazine that [[Zhen|Zhen]]'s collective got into (along with [[Meissa Magazine]]). [[Rumeha|Rumeha]] asked for a copy from [[Zach|Zach]] in exchange for replacing his collection bucket, after he lost his running from [[Sam|Sam]]. Zach gives a copy to Rumeha later, when [[Musa|Musa]] first comes to [[AA-Xerox|the print shop]]. Issues cost somewhere around 0.99 dinars.
