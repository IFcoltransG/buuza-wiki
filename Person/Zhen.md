Huang Zhen (he/him) is the third heir to the [Chevalier Business Conglomerate](Groups/Chevalier%20Business%20Conglomerate.md), which he found out on New Year's Eve 1997. This caused him to attempt to call the Sacred Star Charity Emergency Help Line, but instead found [Zach](Zach.md). The two fell in love over subsequent phone calls. Zhen lives in [Kashgar](../Location/Kashgar.md), although he used to live in [Konstantinyye](../Location/Konstantinyye.md).

He works at a photo studio, developing photographs and handling the bills. He left [Kashgar](../Location/Kashgar.md) to study photography at [University](../Location/University%20of%20Eastern%20Turkistan.md) of [Eastern Turkistan](../Location/Regions/Eastern%20Turkistan.md). When he returned, he put his talents to use at the [design collective](Groups/design%20collective.md) with his friend [Bai Ju](Bai%20Ju.md) who he met at an atalier.

He lives with his [grandfather](Zhen's%20grandfather) and [father](Zhen's%20father), who are from Kashgar. His mother is [Musa's mother](Musa's%20mother.md), because he is the half-brother of [Musa](Musa.md) and [Miriam](Miriam.md). He does not want to find his siblings, partly because he doesn't want media attention.

He is gay, also vegetarian. He is 24 years old.
