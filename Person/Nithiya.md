# Nithiya
Nithiya owns the second-floor flat [[Sam|Sam]] and [[Zach|Zach]] live in, as well as the room she lets [[Sam|Sam]] renovate and use. She is pious: she got her girlfriend [[Saesha]] to install a speaker that plays the Azaan prayer each morning.

She may know about Sam's identity, because she asks about her rich friends and calls her '[[Aibek|Aibekovna]]' rather than just Aibek.

Nithiya is firm in matters of business, and knows [[Emira|Emira]].
