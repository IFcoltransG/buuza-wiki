Nithiya owns the second-floor flat [Sam](Sam.md) and [Zach](Zach.md) live in, as well as the room she lets [Sam](Sam.md) renovate and use. She is pious: she got her girlfriend [Saesha](Saesha) to install a speaker that plays the Azaan prayer each morning.

She may know about Sam's identity, because she asks about her rich friends and calls her '[Aibekovna](Aibek)' rather than just Aibek.

Nithiya is firm in matters of business, and knows [Emira](Emira.md).
