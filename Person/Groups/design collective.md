A fashion and design collective near [Zhen](../Zhen.md)'s photography store, in [Kashgar](../../Location/Kashgar.md). [Reyhan](../Reyhan.md) is their designer. [Zhen](../Zhen.md) is their photographer. [Bai Ju](../Bai%20Ju.md) their model (although she also hems). [Ilham](Ilham) is their pattern cutter for textiles. [Patime](../Patime.md) used to be their photographer and stylist, until she left because of a fight with Bai Ju, her partner. Reyhan and Ju took over the styling after that. It can't pay much, and requires a lot of work, but is emotionally rewarding. Reyhan and Ju put in effort to network and get the collective's name known.
