## Reading the wiki
You can browse the pages in the `/_wiki` directory (as well as `_pages` which contains the [Main Page](/_wiki/index.md)). However for best experience, check out the [website for the wiki](https://ifcoltransg.github.io/buuza-wiki/).

## Editing the wiki
To edit a page, simply make the change, then send a pull request via GitHub.

You can use [GitHub-Flavored Markdown formatting](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) on each page.

If you add a new fact, try to add where you found it in the References section, so readers can find it too.

### New Pages
To create a new page for the wiki, have a read of this template.

```md
---
# This initial section between `---` is 'yaml front matter'.
# It holds metadata like the title and tags.
title: Example Page
# Set the tags here. Have a look down below for tag ideas.
tags: []
---
Put the content of your page here! You can use GitHub-Flavored Markdown for formatting.

[Here's an example link to this example file!](/_wiki/example-page.md)

As you can see above, the file is titled "Example Page", and the file is saved under `example-page.md`.
Make sure your filenames are lowercase with dashes between words (no other punctuation) and end in `.md`.
When you write a link's url, make sure it starts with `/_wiki/`.


## References

- Begin each line of the references with a dash to make a bulleted list

```
