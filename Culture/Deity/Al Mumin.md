# Al Mu'min
Seemingly a cat [god](Culture/Gods.md) (like [Al Muqit and Al Ba'ith](Culture/Deity/Al%20Muqit%20and%20Al%20Baith.md)) associated with summer, or perhaps a dog god. Al Mu'min's followers pray at Fajr, like the followers of [An Nur](Culture/Deity/An%20Nur%20and%20Al%20Hadi.md).

Al Mu'min may be the consort of [Al 'Adl](Culture/Deity/Al%20Adl.md).
